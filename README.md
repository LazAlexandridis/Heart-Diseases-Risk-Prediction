# Heart-Diseases-Risk-Prediction
This repository contains a machine learning solution to predict heart disease risk based on patient data. We evaluate the performance of 8 different models, apply state-of-the-art techniques for data handling, address class imbalance, and perform hyperparameter optimization to ensure the best model performance.

Models Used:

- Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
- Logistic Regression (LR)
- Decision Trees (DT)
- Random Forests (RF)
- k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)
- Na√Øve Bayes (NB)
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)


# Key Techniques
- Stratified k-fold cross-validation for model evaluation and class imbalance
- Randomized Hyperparameter Optimization using RandomSearch
- Statistical Testing to scientifically back up results
- Visualization and evaluation using various plots and metrics

# Dataset
The dataset is publicly available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction/)
